 Personal Website – Homework Project

This is my personal website created as part of the ONVD course homework assignment.

The website is designed as a simple, responsive personal site using only **HTML** and **CSS**. It includes multiple sections that provide a brief overview of me as a person and my interests. Animations and styling were added to create a smooth and appealing experience.

## 🗂️ Website Sections

- **Home** – Introduction with a welcome message and animated elements  
- **About** – Basic biography and overview of interests  
- **Hobbies** – List of personal hobbies with descriptions  
- **Contact** – Simple section with contact information

All styles are written in a single `style.css` file. CSS animations are used to make elements like headers and text pop in on load. The entire site uses a consistent gradient background and drop shadow styling.
