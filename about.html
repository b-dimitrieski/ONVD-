  <h1 class="pop-up"> About me</h1>
  <p class="pop-up"> Hey there! Iâ€™m a 20 year old student studying at FSCE and diving deep into the world of computer science and engineering.
    I enjoy problem-solving, exploring new technologies, and figuring out how to build smarter, more efficient systems. Always up for a challenge and looking to connect with others who share the same passion.</p>
  <p class="pop-up"> I'm especially interested in software development, with a focus on game development, web development, and app development. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code and love the creative and technical challenges each area brings. </p>
  <p class="pop-up">In my free time, I code, read books, hike, travel, play chess, and enjoy other games and activities that keep my mind sharp and inspired.</p>
